# Stellar_Learning
Code For learning how to work with stellar sdk for a web app. 

Code I will be working towards:

- Create accounts, fund them with XLM and with MurphTokens (MUR). Including trustline for non-native assets (non-XLM).
- Further modular code just for sending MUR in repsonse to something (will maybe be a stream listener?)
- See Account Balances (Both XLM and MUR).
- Transfer assets (Send MUR tokens between accounts).
- View Account transaction history (MUR txs in and out).
