# Stellar_Learning
Code For learning how to work with stellar sdk for a web app. 

Code I will be working towards:

- [x] Create accounts, fund them with XLM and with MurphTokens 1, 2, and 3 (MUR1, MUR2, MUR3). Including trustline for non-native assets (non-XLM).
- [x] See Account Balances (Both XLM and MUR).
- [x] Transfer assets (Send MUR tokens between accounts).
- [x] View Account transaction history (MUR txs in and out).
- [ ] Further modularise code just for sending MUR in repsonse to something (will maybe be a stream listener?)
